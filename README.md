silverorange Frontend Developer Exercise
==========================================
This exercise is designed to assess how you approach tasks required in your
position as a frontend developer at silverorange. We are interested to see how
you work as well, as what your final results are; include useful Git commit
messages and comments where you think your code may be unclear.

Express Backend
---------------
With the provided Express framework, implement the `/repos` API endpoint. The
endpoint should aggregate GitHub repository data from the following sources:

 - https://api.github.com/users/silverorange/repos
 - the provided JSON file (in `data/repos.json`). Assume this file can change
   while the service is running.
 
The API endpoint should only return repositories where `repository.fork` is
`false`.

The API endpoint should return JSON encoded data with a content-type of
`application/json`.

### Run

```sh
cd api/
yarn install
yarn start
```

New Page
--------
Using the provided `create-react-app` base, implement the page in the mockup
at https://www.figma.com/file/pirNL6mXMswfRkJQAZsDSK/devtest

For this exercise we are just interested in replicating the visual appearance
of the mockupâ€”no functionality is required. Use appropriate React components,
HTML elements and CSS. For your implementation, divide the page into logical
React components.

A basic responsive template is included in the project to get you started.

### Run

```sh
cd new-page/
yarn install
yarn start
```

Environment
-----------
For this exercise, you can use any stable versions of Node JS and Yarn.
